Your Proof-of-Work is your experience, effort, and impact—documented.

How? Read along…

## 🛠️ What Can a Non-Techie Like Us Do With GitHub?

Still walking along? Let’s go on, Legends!

Think of it as your **public portfolio**, your **Web3 diary**, your **personal wiki**.

Here’s what you can host:

- Blog posts, newsletters, or research
- Strategy decks, marketing plans, case studies
- Twitter growth reports, Discord/Telegram SOPs
- Community playbooks, content calendars

> “If it shows your value, GitHub is where it should live.”

And it’s so true.

## 💡 WHY Should You Care?

- **Web3 projects live on GitHub** – it’s the home of transparency.
- **DAOs love visibility** – they hire what they can see, and GitHub can serve as your digital PoW.
- **Hiring Devs stalk GitHub** to check out great minds.
- **Since most people ignore it, you stand out!**

## 🔍 HOW Do We Go About It?

First, let’s simplify some jargon you’ll see in this category:

### 📁 Repo & `README.md`

- **repo**: Short for “repository.”  
  A repository is a central place where code, files, and all related project history are stored.  
  Think of it as a folder for your project—a diary where you can record all your works. It can be private or public.

- **`README.md`**:  
  This file says “read me first.”  
  It usually sits at the top of your project page on GitHub and acts as a personal “About Me” or project overview.

#### Example `README.md` Format

```markdown
# 👋 Hi, I’m [YourName]

- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me: ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
```

## 🏗️ Create Your First Repo (It’s Easier Than You Think)

- Name it something like:  
  `web3-content-by-[yourname]`

- With that, you can add any of your content to the repo.

Instead of sending tons of pictures to devs, just send them your GitHub link. **Amazing, right?**

Most non-technical folks stop at Twitter threads and vibes.  
While you, reading this thread now, are building digital receipts by using GitHub.  
You’re already steps ahead 🚀

## 🔗 Next Steps

Link your GitHub on:
- 🧾 Your resume
- 🐦 Your Twitter bio

In Web3, your **Proof-of-Work** speaks louder than your pitch.

I just created an account too—check bio for link.  
Let’s navigate the space together!

**Keep building. Keep showing up.**  
**Your digital receipts = your web3 superpower.**
